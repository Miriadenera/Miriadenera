Disclosure:
This theoretical framework, including its physical insights, conceptual structures, and mathematical derivations, was developed by me independently. For the sake of clarity and coherence, I used AI tools to convert my handwritten formulas into LaTeX and to help structure the document in a more fluid and readable way. In the spirit of transparency, I’ve stated this at the beginning of the manuscript. However, all the core ideas, reasoning, and theoretical constructs are entirely my own.

## 🔬 Abstract
Codex Alpha introduces a unified theoretical model that bridges General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics through a new informational metric of spacetime. The theory is grounded in a coherent quantum field called **Telascura**, representing a structured informational network where spacetime emerges from the interactions between entangled quantum nodes.

At the heart of the theory lies the fundamental equation:

$$
\mathcal{G}_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \left\langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \right\rangle_{\nabla \mathcal{K}}
$$

This equation describes the curvature of spacetime as sourced not only by energy–momentum, but by its quantum-coherent expectation value, modulated through an informational gradient of the **Telascura** field.

## 🚀 Vision
Codex Alpha is intended as both a conceptual and computational framework to test the limits of physics through simulation, symbolic inference, and potential lab-scale validation. A vision to unify physics — not just in equations, but in informational structure.
