## 🔬 Abstract
Codex Alpha introduces a unified theoretical model that bridges General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics through a new informational metric of spacetime. The theory is grounded in a coherent quantum field called **Telascura**, representing a structured informational network where spacetime emerges from the interactions between entangled quantum nodes.

At the heart of the theory lies the fundamental equation:

$$
\mathcal{G}_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \left\langle \hat{T}_{\mu\nu} \right\rangle_{\nabla \mathcal{K}}
$$

This equation describes the curvature of spacetime as sourced not only by energy–momentum, but by its quantum-coherent expectation value, modulated through an informational gradient of the **Telascura** field.

## 🚀 Vision
Codex Alpha is intended as both a conceptual and computational framework to test the limits of physics through simulation, symbolic inference, and potential lab-scale validation. A vision to unify physics — not just in equations, but in informational structure.
